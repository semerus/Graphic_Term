Project Type: Game
OS Type: Android
Game Type: FPS (First Person Shooting)

Specification
Game would be a simple 3D FPS game. A player would enter a maze.
The player would encounter some enemies and would need to kill the enemy to proceed.
The enemy would attack back if the player has failed to kill the enemy under certain time limit (ex. less than 3 seconds).
If the enemy is dead due to player°Øs attack, the player would be able to pass. However, if player°Øs HP becomes zero due to enemy°Øs attack, the player would die and become game-over. 
If the player encounters an intersection, the player should decide which passage to go. 
By choosing the correct routes, player would be able to escape from the maze and win the game. In the end it will look very similar to the game Doom.

Control Method
The player would be able to control the game by using the basic touch commands. The shooting part would be done by touching the enemies directly. 
The change of direction would be done by touching each icons that corresponds to left, right, backward, forward. 
The walking would be fully automated, so the player would just need to choose the direction at each intersection.

Development Plan
The development period would be the end of this semester which is mid-June. The total amount of time would be one and half month period.
I would plan out the specifications of the game in the first two weeks including all the UI, assets and design.
The actual programming would be done through the one-month period time. If allowed, I would like to use game engines such as Unity to help be accomplish lot of things in short period of time.
